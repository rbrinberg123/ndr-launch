# NDR Launch — Contact Filtering App

A web app that filters BD Advanced investor contacts by CDF criteria to generate a targeted list for an NDR or roadshow. Built from the `ndr-launch` skill (v10).

---

## What it does

Upload your BD Advanced exports and optionally a company background document (10-K, investor deck). The app:

1. **Infers CDF criteria** from your company documents using AI, or lets you enter them manually
2. **Filters contacts** across four dimensions: Industry Focus, Investment Style, Market Cap, Geography
3. **Routes contacts** to city-based tabs (New York, Boston, etc.) or a single Virtual sheet
4. **Enriches results** with ownership data and meeting history from Activities.xlsx
5. **Tracks other-company meetings** — contacts met under non-subject tickers appear with `Other: TICK1, TICK2` in the Source column
6. **Splits output** into structured sheets: Contacts, HFs, DNC, Check, Quant, Activist, Excluded
6. **Downloads** a formatted Excel file ready to use

## Input files

| File | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Contacts w CDFs.xlsx` | ✅ | Main contacts export from bdadvanced.ipreo.com (header row 3) |
| `Ownership.xlsx` | Optional | Adds `Shares` column (header row 5) |
| `Fund-Level Ownership.xlsx` | Optional | Adds four fund-level columns (header row 5) |
| `Activities.xlsx` | Optional | Adds six meeting history columns; used for meeting exclusion |
| Company document (PDF) | Optional | 10-K, investor deck, etc. — triggers AI CDF recommendations |

## Output sheets

| Sheet | Contents |
|---|---|
| `[City]` or `Contacts` | Filtered contacts routed by city, or all contacts if Virtual |
| `Virtual` | Contacts not matching any selected city (only when cities are chosen) |
| `HFs` | Hedge funds (if HF treatment = No or Low-turnover only) |
| `DNC` | Do Not Contact |
| `Check` | Contacts flagged for review |
| `Quant` | Quantitative funds |
| `Activist` | Contacts where Activist = Often |
| `Excluded` | Contacts excluded by meeting history rule or shareholder threshold |
| `Activity-Only` | Contacts found in Activities.xlsx but not in the contacts file |

Contacts from Activities.xlsx that only appear under non-subject tickers are appended to the main results with a `Source` value of `Other: TICK1, TICK2` listing which tickers they were met under. Their meeting history columns are left blank since the meetings were for other companies.

## Workflow options

**Hedge fund treatment**
- Include all in main results
- Move all HFs to a separate sheet
- Keep low-turnover (T/O ≤ 100%) in main results, move high-turnover to HFs sheet

**City routing**
- Virtual (single Contacts sheet)
- 1–4 cities → creates one tab per city + a Virtual catch-all tab

Supported city shortcuts: NY/NYC, Boston, Chicago, Philly, SF, LA, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Florida/Miami, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Toronto, Columbus, Kansas City, San Antonio.

**Shareholder exclusion**
- Include all (default)
- Exclude all shareholders
- Exclude shareholders above a threshold: >0.01%, >0.02%, >0.03%, >0.4%, >0.5%
- Uses the `% S/O` column from the Ownership file (falls back to column E if not found by name)
- Contacts exceeding the threshold are moved to the Excluded sheet with reason "Exceeds Shareholder Limit"

**Meeting history exclusion**
- Include all
- Exclude contacts met in L12M
- Exclude contacts met in L24M
- Exclude all contacts with any prior meeting history
